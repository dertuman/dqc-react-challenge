# About the project

The project may involve certain "overengineering" to showcase some of the techonologies I'm comfortable working with.

# About Vercel

This test uses Vercel to showcase my preffered deployment system. Every time a commit is made, a new instance is
created with it's own domain. This allows for virtually infinite staging environments.
